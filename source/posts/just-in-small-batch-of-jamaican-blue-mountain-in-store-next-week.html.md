Because it’s the duty of every Muslim to understand the Quran, it will be a proof of our faith in Allah on the Day of Judgment, our status in this life before Allah will be higher than if we don’t read the Quran, and our position in Paradise is even higher for each letter of the Quran that we read!

My brother in Islam, you must know that reciting and reflecting over the Quran and devoting time regularly to its study and its’ implementation in one’s life has tremendous benefits here and in the Hereafter.
