As one of the five pillars of Islam, zakat is mandatory giving; all Muslims eligible to pay it must donate at least 2.5% of their accumulated wealth for the benefit of the poor, destitute and others â€“ classified as mustahik. It is one of the largest forms of wealth transfer to the poor in existence.
